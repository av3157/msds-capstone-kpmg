    Example short answer response: The datasource for the Monthly Sales Trend field is 2 nodes upstream.
    
    Example of long answer response:

    The main differences between the latest version (Employee Productivity Model Version3) and the previous version (Employee Productivity Model Version2) of the Employee Productivity Prediction Model are as follows:
    
    1. Model Parameters:
        - Version3: Decision Tree algorithm with a maximum depth of 8 and a minimum samples split of 4.
        - Version2: Random Forest algorithm with 100 trees, a maximum depth of 10, and a minimum samples split of 2.

    2. Top Features:
        - Version3: The top features considered in Version3 are PerformanceScore (0.55), PerformanceReviewDate (0.25), and EmployeeID (0.2).
        - Version2: The top features considered in Version2 are PerformanceScore (0.4), PerformanceReviewDate (0.3), PerformanceComments (0.2), and EmployeeID (0.1).

    Overall, the key differences between the two versions lie in the choice of algorithm used, the parameters of the algorithm, and the weightage assigned to the top features in the model.
